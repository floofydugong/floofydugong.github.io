## About

For those that don't know me, **Hayw1re** is the in-game name that I play under. The name "Hayw1re" was inspired by the playstyle of my favorite Dota 2 professional gamer, Funn1k. In the past, I've played under many different aliases. Some of these names include **Kuhero616**, which was used during my semi-professional career as a top 10 ranked Warcraft III player, and **floofydugong** which was used during my casual college gaming days.

After quitting my job in Virginia and moving to California to attend Metis, I felt that it was fitting for me to transition away from my old names to a new one that I could identify with. Though a part of me may still be a bit "floofy" or "hero"-like, I can already feel that I am growing into something new and different.

This is me going Hayw1re.
