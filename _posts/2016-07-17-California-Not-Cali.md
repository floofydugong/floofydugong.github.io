As a part of the course work, Metis requires that students blog at least three times before graduating. I'll be honest. I've never been the type to blog or journal. While packing for my move from Virginia to California, I found my personal journal which had less then a dozen entries. :confused: Hopefully, I'm a lot more committed (and better at writing) now than I was before. :wink:

My goal is to not only write posts regarding technical subjects, but also to write some offbeat material including highglights from my experiences living in San Francisco and also fields that I'm interested in, such as eSports analytics. For those of you who are looking for more resources on data science, I also plan on organizing and sharing all my resources/material that I've collected along the way on my journey to becoming a better data scientist.

To kick things off, I thought I'd keep it light and start with a fun list of things that I've learned while living in California. Feel free to comment and share your thoughts!

**Please note that I am still working out the kinks to this site...so not all links may work**

## Cali(fornia) and I
1. No one from California calls it "Cali".
2. Still trying to figure out how to quantify "hella"
3. Tacos are everywhere (and they're so cheap too!)
4. Based on yelp reviews, people hate Chipotle (I don't blame them when there's more authentic meals to be had)
5. Driving anything further than 15 minutes is considered far for locals.
6. San Francisco is actually 7x7...which is tiny compared to D.C (10x10)
7. Stop signs exists **EVERYWHERE**
8. Learning how to parallel park is a must (especially on steep hills)
9. The people are super friendly. I've had tons of great encounters, especially in Uber Pool rides!
10. I walk about 6 miles a day (barely drive)
