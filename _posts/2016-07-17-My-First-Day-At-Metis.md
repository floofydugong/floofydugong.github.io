I'm going to switch gears a bit and post about my experience during my first week at Metis. I'll probably do more of a Q&A sort of post in the future that dives deeper into what a week realy feels like at Metis, but for now, I'll keep the weekly summary brief.

The day before my first class came along, and I had just completed the course's prework, which took quite some time and was fairly challenging. Looking back, the prework material really did give me a solid foundation for the class(so for those of you who are pushing it off, get to it!).

First day of class came along, and I walked into into the class with really no expectations. I heard that coding bootcamps were tough, but I had never met anyone who had completed the Metis Bootcamp before. I was pleasantly surprised when I had a chance to look at the the schedule for the first few days day. It seemed well planned and manageable if I spent my time wisely.

The day kicked off with some breakfast and introductions from the faculty members. After introductions and some "housekeeping", we were given a pair programming problem to solve. It was a pretty tough one actually, but it sparked a lot of fruitful discussions and pushed us to really think outside the box. Before I knew it, it was already lunch time.

After lunch, we were given a a tutorial on how to use Git and then got got placed into our groups for our first project. At Metis, they codename each of the projects with the name of an investigator from a t.v show to follow a sort of "investigation" theme. The first one was named Benson, after a detective on Law and Order. The rest of the day was spent working on challenges (a.k.a homework) and also planning with my group.

> TL:DR : Here's what my a typical day at Metis looks like:

- 9:00 am: Good morning! â˜•
- 9:15 am: Pair Programming Problem
- 10:00 am: Review Pair Programming
- 10:15 am: Break
- 10:30 am: Lecture
- 12:00 pm: Lunch
- 1:30 pm: Investigation Presentation (I'll write more about this in the future)
- 2:00 pm: Lecture
- 3:00 pm - 6:00 pm: This generally varies, but this is time usually spent working on homework (also known as challenges), group projects, or listening to speakers.

Hope you enjoyed the read! Stay tuned for my blog post about **Project Benson**!ðŸ™‚
